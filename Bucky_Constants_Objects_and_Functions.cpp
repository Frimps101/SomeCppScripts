// Some objects you create, you might not want them to be modified therefore the const keyword is used
// Whenever you have a constant object, you cant call regular functions with them, you can only call functions that are themselves constants
// So constant objects need constant functions
// Whenever you create a constant function, you need to make sure that its constant both in the prototype in the header file and in the definition(C++ source file)
